# Stripped theme by Accomplice
## Why?
The perfect theme when using, for example, Vue cli or Create React App to build your wordpress website. 

##Example of use (with Vue cli):

1. Setup of wordpress
2. Install theme
3. Run `vue create .`
4. Done!

Now you have a theme setup with Vue and running on all paths. Wordpress handles header and footer (nice for plugins). 
You can use vue create `npm run serve` for development and get current page data with ajax or print it on the page. `npm run build` do run with wordpress.
