# Stripped theme by Accomplice
## Why?
The perfect theme when using, for example, Vue cli or Create React App to build your wordpress website. 

## Example of use (with vue cli):

1. Setup wordpress
2. Install theme
3. Run `vue create .`
4. Done!

Now you have a theme setup with Vue and running on all paths. Wordpress handles header and footer (nice for plugins). 
You can use vue create `npm run serve` for development and get current page data with wp-rest. `npm run build` to run with wordpress.
